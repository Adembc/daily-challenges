# üèÜ Daily Coding Challenges

Welcome to the Daily Coding Challenges repository! This repository is created to enhance problem-solving skills and encourage commitment by solving at least one problem each day.

## üìã How It Works

1. **Daily Challenges**:
   - Each day, a new coding challenge is posted in the [Daily Challenges Log](challenges/challenges.md).

2. **Solve the Challenge**:
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
   - Create a folder under `solutions/` with your GitHub username (if it doesn‚Äôt already exist).
   - Save your solutions using the format:
      - `solutions/your-username/accepted/dd-mm-yyyy.cpp` (for accepted solutions).
      - `solutions/your-username/attempts/dd-mm-yyyy.cpp` (for trial or in-progress solutions).

3. **Submit Your Solution**:
   - Open a pull request with your solution to the `main` branch.
   - Use the following format for your PR title:
     ```
     dd-mm-yyyy(status): username
     ```
      - **Example PR Titles**:
         - `04-01-2025(ac): adembc` (Accepted solution)

   - **Status Codes**:
      - **AC**: Accepted (solution is correct).
      - **WA**: Wrong Answer (solution doesn‚Äôt produce the expected output).
      - **TLE**: Time Limit Exceeded (solution takes too long to execute).
      - **CS**: Can't Solve (unable to solve the challenge).
